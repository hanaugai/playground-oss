there are two patterns. that depends on the destination protocol is HTTP or HTTPS.

client <-> proxy <-> server


client -> proxy
          proxy -> server
          proxy <- server
client <- proxy

- HTTP

proxy just forwards b/w client and server.

- HTTPS

two steps. one is connect. the other is forwarding request/response data.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT

client <-> proxy              : ask proxy to connect server by CONNECT method
           proxy <-> server   : establish TLS connection on behalf of client and continues proxy the TCP stream to and from client

the data to server is tunnneled by HTTP b/w client and proxy
